            \ourname{} is a multi-view to multi-view model that enhances low-quality 3D shapes. It corrects fine-grained geometry details and adds appearance features. 
            The top row displays three degraded shapes and their enhancements by \ourname. 
            The bottom row demonstrates \ourname's capability to edit the appearance of 3D shapes.
