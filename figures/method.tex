    \caption{Overview of 3D generation pipeline with \ourname{}.
    First, a 3D object is generated with Shap-E. Then, we render six views of this low-quality object. \ourname{} is a diffusion model based on Stable Diffusion~\cite{rombach2022highresolutionimagesynthesislatent} that enhances these views with the guidance of a text prompt by refining geometry and adding detailed appearance. \ourname{} employs cross-attention layers for text-based guidance and self-attention layers for cross-view consistency. A high-quality 3D object can be reconstructed from the multi-view image set.}
